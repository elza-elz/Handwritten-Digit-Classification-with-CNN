# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-with-CNN
This project uses a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It processes grayscale images, applies convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, and trains using the Adam optimizer. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the model achieves high accuracy and visualizes sample predictions.
